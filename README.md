# GroceryListApp

The gorcery list app will allow the user to add different products and their quantities in his own account.

After that the grocery and the quantity can be sent via email using SMTP.

The application uses only basic HTML/CSS and Flask.

The application uses Postgres so it is needed to adjust the .env file in the local directory

The SMTP setup for the email server also needs to be adjusted with personal details (either added directly or in env)
